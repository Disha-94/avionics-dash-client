let's get started with talking about the
\n0:05
types of certificates that are out there
\n0:07
and the certificates that you're gonna
\n0:09
get really depends on what you want to
\n0:11
do in aviation there are people that
\n0:14
just want to fly for fun and there are
\n0:15
people that want to do this for a living
\n0:17
depending on which path you decide to
\n0:19
choose then you're going to have to give
\n0:21
different types of certificates now in
\n0:23
this course I'm gonna mention the word
\n0:25
certificate and license they're the same
\n0:28
thing okay there's something that you're
\n0:29
gonna get from the FAA the FAA is the
\n0:32
only entity in the country the Federal
\n0:35
Aviation Administration that is going to
\n0:38
grant certificates to pilots there is no
\n0:41
local requirement no state requirement
\n0:43
everything is based on the FA which is a
\n0:45
federal organization so the first
\n0:49
certificate that you're gonna get is a
\n0:50
student pilot certificate now I'm going
\n0:52
to go in detail on each of these
\n0:54
certificates in a second but it starts
\n0:56
with student pilots when you're learning
\n0:58
the next thing is going to be the
\n0:59
possibility of getting a recreational
\n1:02
pilot certificate again I'll talk about
\n1:04
it in a second then we have a sport
\n1:06
pilot certificate and the private pilot
\n1:08
certificate now you're going to choose
\n1:10
from one of these three as your first
\n1:12
certificate so recreational sport and
\n1:15
private and then the next level is going
\n1:17
to be a commercial pilot certificate and
\n1:19
finally the highest possible level is
\n1:21
going to be an airline transport pilot
\n1:24
certificate that's what we call a tipi
\n1:26
airline transport pilot so let's get
\n1:29
started let's talk about the student
\n1:30
pilot certificate this is your learner's
\n1:34
permit this is what you're going to be
\n1:36
using in order to learn to fly an
\n1:38
airplane what it does it allows you to
\n1:40
fly as a the sole manipulators of the
\n1:45
control this is the the key words from
\n1:46
the FAA this is basically going to allow
\n1:48
you to fly solo fly by yourself before
\n1:50
you get your private pilot's license now
\n1:53
as you can imagine it's going to take a
\n1:54
few hours usually about 20 to 30 hours
\n1:56
before you get to your first solo and
\n1:59
then you'll be able to fly by yourself
\n2:01
so that's kind of the the goal of the
\n2:04
the first step of your pilot license is
\n2:06
going to be to get to that first solo in
\n2:09
order to get this you need to be at
\n2:11
least 16 years old and you need to be
\n2:13
able to read speak and
\n2:15
stay in English so that's the
\n2:17
requirements were here from the FAA and
\n2:18
the good news is the student pilot
\n2:20
certificate is free you can get it with
\n2:23
the help of a fly instructor all it's
\n2:25
gonna take is for you to go on the FAA
\n2:28
website submit an application have you
\n2:31
fly instructors sign it and then you
\n2:32
have a little document in the mail and
\n2:35
that document that you can see right
\n2:37
here is going to basically tell your
\n2:40
flight store that your student pilot you
\n2:42
ready to fly there are some restrictions
\n2:44
some limitations to the student pilot
\n2:47
certificate you can only fly by yourself
\n2:50
without a fly instructor but only if you
\n2:53
have an endorsement the next thing is
\n2:55
you cannot carry any passengers nobody
\n2:58
can come with you when you do these solo
\n3:00
flights and the last one which is
\n3:02
somewhat obvious but you cannot fly for
\n3:04
compensation you cannot make money as a
\n3:06
pilot if you only have a student pilot
\n3:08
certificate okay
\n3:10
so that's your first step that's going
\n3:11
to be a student pilot certificate from
\n3:12
here you have the choice of becoming
\n3:15
either a sport pilot or recreational
\n3:17
pilot or private pilot now the sport
\n3:20
pilots is kind of the the most recent
\n3:22
certificate that the FA created and
\n3:25
that's kind of the lowest level of
\n3:28
pirate now I don't say that in a mean
\n3:30
way or in a bad way in a diminishing way
\n3:32
this is just a the lowest level because
\n3:34
it has the most limitations okay you
\n3:37
need to be at least 16 years old to get
\n3:39
a sport pilot certificate and you either
\n3:41
have to have a medical certificate or
\n3:43
have a driver's license and this is the
\n3:46
only certificate here where you will be
\n3:48
able to fly by yourself without having a
\n3:51
medical certificate and that's the part
\n3:53
of the appeal for a lot of people is
\n3:56
giving a sport pilot license because
\n3:58
they can't pass an FAA medical
\n4:00
certificate will talk about the medicals
\n4:02
in a in a few minutes in the next video
\n4:04
but this is what it is with this now the
\n4:07
the one thing with this certificate you
\n4:10
can actually fly without an endorsement
\n4:12
from a fly instructor endorsement
\n4:15
meaning just to sign up somebody's
\n4:17
saying yeah this guy's or this girl is
\n4:18
ready to fly and you can only be the in
\n4:22
command of what we call a light sport
\n4:25
aircraft which is a smaller type of air
\n4:27
the minimum number of hours to get your
\n4:30
sport pilot license is going to be 20
\n4:33
hours of total time and with this you
\n4:36
cannot you can you can carry passenger
\n4:39
sorry you cannot receive compensation
\n4:40
and you cannot fly when the visibility
\n4:43
is restricted outside when it's less
\n4:45
than 3 statute miles
\n4:46
now this might sound like very technical
\n4:49
speak but it's basically when the
\n4:52
visibility outside when it's foggy or
\n4:54
cloudy you basically can't go and fly
\n4:56
with that license so that's again the
\n4:59
sport pilot certificate right here the
\n5:01
next level up would be what we call a
\n5:03
recreational pilot now sport pilots
\n5:06
recreational pilots is the lowest number
\n5:09
of licenses issued every year by the fa
\n5:13
recreational pilot you have to be 17
\n5:16
years old in order to do this you have
\n5:18
to be able to read write and understand
\n5:20
English just like all the other licenses
\n5:22
and in this case you actually have to
\n5:24
pass a knowledge test and also pass a
\n5:26
practical test in order to get the
\n5:28
certificate compared to the other one
\n5:32
the sport pilot license you also need to
\n5:34
have a third class medical certificate
\n5:36
you need to go to a person call a
\n5:39
Novation medical examiner and they need
\n5:41
to examine you and I was gonna say
\n5:45
inspect examine you and basically make
\n5:47
sure that you're fit to fly and then
\n5:49
they'll give you a certificate the the
\n5:51
total time instead of being 20 hours
\n5:53
like the the sport pilots this is 30
\n5:55
hours of flight time the privileges with
\n5:58
the recreational pilot certificate is
\n6:00
that you can actually carry the
\n6:01
passengers but no more than one so you
\n6:04
can only carry one passenger in there
\n6:05
and the passengers that you carry they
\n6:08
have to pay at least half of the
\n6:10
expenses when you fly you cannot say hey
\n6:13
tell I'll go to a friend and say hey
\n6:15
I'll take you up on the flight if you
\n6:16
pay for all the gas and all the expenses
\n6:19
you can't do that you have to be at
\n6:21
least half of the expenses that's just
\n6:23
an FAA regulation it's something that's
\n6:25
pretty common some of the limitations of
\n6:27
the recreational pilot certificate is
\n6:29
you can do cross-country over 50
\n6:32
nautical miles from the airport that you
\n6:34
departed unless you have an endorsement
\n6:36
from an instructor but that's somewhat
\n6:38
of a big limitation so if you want to
\n6:40
fly
\n6:40
further than 50 miles from where you're
\n6:42
based you can't do that you can't fly at
\n6:45
night and you cannot fly where radio
\n6:48
communications are required which is
\n6:50
also a pretty big limitation larger
\n6:52
airport will have communication required
\n6:55
so in this case you have to stay away
\n6:57
from these airports and in this case
\n7:00
also you cannot act as the pilot in
\n7:03
command which means be in control of the
\n7:05
airplane if it has more than four seats
\n7:08
available and you can you can carry more
\n7:10
than four people on board the airplane
\n7:12
okay so you'll be restricted in the size
\n7:14
of the airplane that you can fly next
\n7:17
thing is our private pilot certificate
\n7:20
which is the most popular certificate
\n7:23
for people that want to go and have fun
\n7:25
and just fly for fly for fun you have to
\n7:28
be 17 years old in order to get your
\n7:30
private pilot's certificate and again
\n7:32
you have to be able to read write and
\n7:34
understand English and you also have to
\n7:37
pass a written exam and you also have to
\n7:39
pass a practical test now I'm going to
\n7:41
give you more information about the
\n7:42
written exam and a practical test in a
\n7:44
minute and kind of tell you what this is
\n7:46
going to look like you also need to have
\n7:48
a third class medical certificate like
\n7:50
the recreational pilot and in this case
\n7:52
you need 40 hours not 30 so it goes up
\n7:55
to 40 hours of total time you need 20
\n7:59
hours of these 40 hours you need to have
\n8:01
at least 20 hours of instruction and 10
\n8:03
hours of solo flying by yourself so
\n8:06
you're gonna say 20 plus 30 plus 10 that
\n8:08
adds up to 30 you're right
\n8:10
the other 10 hours can be a mix of these
\n8:13
two okay so that's why we are here the
\n8:16
the privileges of the Private Pilot
\n8:18
certificate is that you can carry
\n8:20
passengers now you can carry passengers
\n8:22
more than one in this case compared to
\n8:25
the recreational pilot and again you
\n8:27
have to spread the expenses between all
\n8:30
you passengers so if you take two of
\n8:32
your friends or two of your family
\n8:34
members with you then you have to split
\n8:36
the cost three ways between all of the
\n8:38
pilots all right and you can't fly for
\n8:41
business you cannot make money from
\n8:44
being a private pilot's you cannot
\n8:46
receive compensation for flying that's
\n8:48
what we do with the commercial pilot
\n8:50
certificates
\n8:50
okay so one ago fly for fun first step
\n8:54
is
\n8:54
maybe to become a private pilot the next
\n8:58
level up after this is going to be your
\n9:00
commercial pilot certificate and to get
\n9:03
a commercial pilot certificate you first
\n9:05
need to get a private pilot certificate
\n9:07
so first step is always going to be the
\n9:10
private and then you move on to the
\n9:11
commercial in this case the biggest
\n9:14
thing with commercial pilot certificate
\n9:15
is you can actually receive compensation
\n9:17
for flying you can start making money
\n9:19
for being a pilot you have to be 18
\n9:22
years old to do this you have to be able
\n9:24
to read write and understand English and
\n9:26
you also have to pass a test or
\n9:28
knowledge test and a practical test with
\n9:30
the FAA and in this case you need what's
\n9:32
called second class medical certificate
\n9:33
all the other ones were called third
\n9:36
class medical certificate you guessed it
\n9:39
there's three classes of certificates
\n9:41
third classes kind of the lowest level
\n9:43
second class and in the first class on
\n9:45
top of it we'll talk about the details
\n9:47
in a minute in order to be a commercial
\n9:50
pilot you need to have 250 hours of
\n9:53
total time and that's a lot more than
\n9:57
the 40 hours for private so it's going
\n9:59
to take a lot more experience and
\n10:01
obviously it's going to be a lot more
\n10:03
expensive what can you do with a
\n10:05
commercial pilot certificate well you
\n10:07
can fly for pretty much any outfit out
\n10:09
there that is flying except for the
\n10:12
airlines so if you want to fly for an
\n10:14
airline then you will need to have an
\n10:16
airline transport pilot certificate and
\n10:18
ATP now ATP is the highest possible
\n10:21
level of pilot certificate once you have
\n10:24
an ATP you've made it okay you're at the
\n10:27
top this is going to be required if you
\n10:30
want to be flying for an airline if you
\n10:33
want to be flying for Delta for United
\n10:35
for American whoever it is then you can
\n10:37
need to have an ATP alright and the
\n10:39
minimum requirement for this is actually
\n10:41
1500 hours 1500 hours there are
\n10:45
exceptions that can go where you can get
\n10:48
that limited reduced to a thousand hours
\n10:52
if you go to a four-year degree program
\n10:55
for example if you go to a large
\n10:56
University then you'll be that that
\n10:58
teaches flight and Aeronautical
\n11:00
University and you'll be able to get
\n11:02
that reduced to a thousand hours but
\n11:03
fifteen hundred to a thousand hours to
\n11:06
get an ATP and you need to beat one
\n11:08
three years old so a little bit older a
\n11:10
little bit more experienced obviously
\n11:11
these are the people are going to be
\n11:13
flying you when you fly commercials so
\n11:15
if you want to be flying somebody
\n11:17
commercially in an airliner then this is
\n11:20
what you're gonna have to go through all
\n11:22
right
\n11:22
now I get a lot of questions about the
\n11:24
ATP and people say how do I get 1500
\n11:27
hours or a thousand hours well most
\n11:30
people don't pay for these hours you get
\n11:32
paid in order to build your flight time
\n11:34
and then you move on and go if life with
\n11:36
the Airlines so most people will get
\n11:38
their commercial certificates and then
\n11:39
they'll go find a job for example flying
\n11:42
I live close to the Grand Canyon so they
\n11:44
go fly for an outfit that gives tours at
\n11:47
the Grand Canyon
\n11:47
that you can do with the commercial
\n11:49
pilot's certificate build up your hours
\n11:51
and then move on to the airline's some
\n11:54
people do drop skydivers so you go out
\n11:57
there and you fly the airplanes that go
\n11:59
up drop the skydivers and come back and
\n12:01
come back down we have people that do
\n12:03
work for surveying companies all right
\n12:06
they you go out there and you take
\n12:07
pictures in the grid and then build up
\n12:09
your flight time people become fly
\n12:11
instructors this is what I did when I
\n12:12
started my career I wanted to be an
\n12:14
airline pilot eventually it never
\n12:16
happened but I'm still really glad with
\n12:19
what I did but the to build your flight
\n12:22
time you became a fly instructor and
\n12:24
then you start building hours by
\n12:25
teaching people how to fly I learned
\n12:28
that I really enjoy teaching people so
\n12:29
this is what I do today which is again I
\n12:32
know something that I absolutely love
\n12:34
doing so so that's your ATP difference
\n12:37
between the commercial and the ATP
\n12:38
certificates and and I'll talk a little
\n12:41
bit more about this in the future but
\n12:42
your your typical path when you're
\n12:45
wanting to become an airline pilot is
\n12:48
going to start with a private pilot
\n12:51
certificate then we're going to do
\n12:53
what's called an instrument rating I'm
\n12:54
going to talk about the instrument
\n12:55
rating in a second it's not a
\n12:56
certificate it's just a a special
\n13:00
training that you get added onto your
\n13:03
certificate then people become a
\n13:05
commercial pilot and then people become
\n13:07
an ATP so that's kind of the process
\n13:09
private commercial ATP and then
\n13:12
eventually you can fly for an airline if
\n13:14
you want to do this for fun do your
\n13:16
private pilot that's all you have to do
\n13:18
maybe get an instrument rating again
\n13:20
I'll talk about this
\n13:21
second because I think it makes you a
\n13:23
safer pilot so let's go ahead let's talk
\n13:25
about the instrument reading because it
\n13:26
falls under other it's it's gold rating
\n13:29
a rating is something that's going to be
\n13:31
added to your certificates and in this
\n13:34
case in an instrument rating is somebody
\n13:37
who wants to fly by only by reference to
\n13:40
the instrument
\n13:41
now you've been maybe in a commercial
\n13:43
flight and at one point you get into the
\n13:45
clouds well if you just the private
\n13:47
pilot's you have to remain clear of the
\n13:50
class you have to stay away from the
\n13:51
clouds you always have to be able to see
\n13:53
the ground now when you're clad you can
\n13:55
do that so in this case you need what's
\n13:57
called an instrument rating instrument
\n13:58
means you'll be able to look at the
\n14:00
instruments in the cockpit and basically
\n14:02
fly the airplane by referencing the
\n14:05
instruments so that's one thing that's
\n14:07
the instrument rating it can be added to
\n14:09
a private pilot certificate or a
\n14:11
commercial pilot certificate or an ATP
\n14:14
once you get your instrument rating and
\n14:16
you get a new certificate it's gonna
\n14:18
follow you so most people do private
\n14:21
then they add on the instrument rating
\n14:24
and then they get become a commercial
\n14:26
pilot because they already had the
\n14:28
instrument rating then a bit gets added
\n14:30
to their certificate and then same thing
\n14:32
when you become an ATP alright another
\n14:35
thing that you can do and that's when
\n14:36
you start flying larger aircraft is get
\n14:39
a type rating if you see people that fly
\n14:42
a 747 a a320 a340 whatever larger
\n14:47
aircraft out there they have a type
\n14:50
rating it means that they receive
\n14:51
special training to fly that airplane
\n14:54
specifically okay and again you'll get
\n14:57
that as you start flying larger aircraft
\n14:59
in the aircraft over 12,500 pounds is
\n15:02
going to need to have a type rating
\n15:04
another certificate that you can get
\n15:06
which is in addition to your regular
\n15:08
certificate is a fly instructor
\n15:10
certificate
\n15:11
I'm a fly instructor and I have a
\n15:13
separate card a separate certificate
\n15:16
that says I'm a fly instructor before
\n15:18
you become a fly instructor you have to
\n15:20
be a commercial pilot so so commercial
\n15:23
pilots then you can create you can add a
\n15:25
fly instructor certificate to your list
\n15:27
and that's basically just another card
\n15:29
from the FAA that says you can teach
\n15:31
people like I'm doing in our courses at
\n15:33
pilot and
\n15:34
get another certificate that you can get
\n15:37
a third card is going to be your remote
\n15:40
pilot certificate and remote pilot is if
\n15:42
you want to fly a UAS or drones for
\n15:45
commercial purposes and you need to get
\n15:47
what's called a remote pilot certificate
\n15:49
I also have one of these I also teach
\n15:51
classes on how to do this at part of
\n15:53
Institute and just another way to be
\n15:55
involved with aviation now at the very
\n15:59
end of this and then this is where it
\n16:01
can get confusing not complicated just
\n16:03
confusing is there are different levels
\n16:08
where you can get your licenses I don't
\n16:10
want to go into too crazy of terms but
\n16:12
you can get a single air a single-engine
\n16:15
certificate or you can get a
\n16:17
multi-engine certificate for example
\n16:19
when you start your flight training
\n16:20
you're going to be flying in a small
\n16:22
airplane with only one engine this is
\n16:25
called single-engine so when you get
\n16:27
your license your private pilot license
\n16:29
you will get it as private pilot license
\n16:32
single-engine it means that if somebody
\n16:34
has an airplane that has two engines and
\n16:36
you want to fly it you can't because you
\n16:38
are not trained to fly in a multi-engine
\n16:41
airplane so you can add that most people
\n16:43
will add the multi-engine rating when
\n16:46
they get to the to the commercial level
\n16:50
so they'll get a commercial single and
\n16:52
in a commercial multi-engine or
\n16:54
sometimes they get a commercial
\n16:55
multi-engine and a commercial
\n16:57
single-engine so on top of all this we
\n17:01
have land versus sea
\n17:03
so I'll give you an example I have a
\n17:05
commercial pilot certificate with single
\n17:08
and multi-engine land because I can fly
\n17:11
airplane that land at an airport I do
\n17:14
not have a seaplane certificate so I
\n17:16
cannot go and fly an airplane that lands
\n17:19
on lakes or on the river on the creek or
\n17:21
on in the ocean alright so that's a
\n17:24
separate rating that I do not have if I
\n17:27
wanted to I could go get the training
\n17:29
and then add it to my certificate but
\n17:31
single-engine land multi-engine land
\n17:35
single-engine sea multi-engine sea
\n17:38
those are the different types of rating
\n17:39
you can get for airplane there are also
\n17:42
people out there that fly helicopters I
\n17:44
can't fly a helicopters because I didn't
\n17:46
get the training but
\n17:47
we'd get a rotorcraft license with a
\n17:49
helicopter rating on it that tells me I
\n17:51
can basically fly helicopters so now you
\n17:54
can kind of try to understand the
\n17:56
different certificates and then the
\n17:58
ratings that get added to it for you
\n18:01
more than likely if you want to do this
\n18:03
for fun you'll get a private pilot
\n18:05
single-engine land ok and then as you
\n18:10
get more experience maybe you want to
\n18:12
add as a private pilot multi-engine land
\n18:15
if you want to do this for fun if you
\n18:17
want to make a career out of it you're
\n18:19
going to have to get a commercial pilot
\n18:21
single and multi-engine land in most
\n18:24
cases this is what most people will do
\n18:26
to fly for the airlines and then
\n18:28
eventually they'll get an ATP to fly for
\n18:31
the airlines I hope this is not too
\n18:33
confusing if it is please leave a
\n18:35
comment in the video and I'll be happy
\n18:37
to guide you and provide you more
\n18:38
information but this is kind of the big
\n18:41
idea with all these different
\n18:43
certificates so let's go ahead and talk
\n18:44
about medical certificates in the next
\n18:46
